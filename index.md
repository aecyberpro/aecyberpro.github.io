I'm Steve Campbell, also known as @lpha3ch0.

>The vision to lead the way forward with the experience to avoid the pitfalls.

I'm a U.S. Navy veteran and worked in Aviation Electronics (AE ~ @lpha3ch0) before switching to Information Technology. I have more than 18 years of combined IT and penetration testing experience. Before changing my focus to penetration testing, I worked in numerous IT and security engineering roles. This experience adds context to my report deliverables and remediation recommendations.

## Experience
I have planned, scoped, lead, and performed penetration testing engagements on various major enterprises, such as: Fortune 500, government institutions, banking, finance, healthcare and insurance, ecommerce, legal, and energy sector clients. These engagements provided deep insights to the organization on their weak points, how they can be connected to a full attack vector, how they can be monitored, detected, quarantined, and remediated.

I share my experience and insight through training and mentoring CDW consultants and ensuring the quality of report deliverables.
