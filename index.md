## Whoami
I'm Steve Campbell, also known as @lpha3ch0.

I'm a retired U.S. Navy veteran where I worked as an Aviation Electrician (AE ~ @lpha3ch0) before switching to Information Technology. I have more than 18 years of combined IT and penetration testing experience. Before changing my focus to penetration testing, I worked in various IT and security engineering roles. This experience adds context to my pentest report deliverables and remediation recommendations.

I'm also a father and husband. In my spare time I enjoy learning new things related to hacking, and taking my wife on motorcycle rides.

## Experience

I have planned, scoped, lead, and performed penetration testing engagements on various major enterprises, such as: Fortune 500, government institutions, banking, finance, healthcare and insurance, ecommerce, legal, and energy sector clients. These engagements provided deep insights to the organization on their weak points, how they can be connected to a full attack vector, how they can be monitored, detected, quarantined, and remediated.

I share my experience and insight through training and mentoring consultants and ensuring the quality of report deliverables.
