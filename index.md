## Whoami
I'm Steve Campbell, also known as @lpha3ch0. Check out my blog while you're here.

I'm a retired U.S. Navy veteran where I worked as an Aviation Electrician (AE ~ @lpha3ch0) before switching to Information Technology. I have more than 18 years of combined IT and penetration testing experience. Before changing my focus to penetration testing, I worked in various IT and security engineering roles. This experience adds context to my pentest report deliverables and remediation recommendations.

I'm also a father and husband. In my spare time I enjoy learning new things related to hacking, and taking my wife on motorcycle rides.

## Experience

I have planned, scoped, lead, and performed penetration testing engagements on various major enterprises, such as: Fortune 500, government institutions, banking, finance, healthcare and insurance, ecommerce, legal, and energy sector clients. These engagements provided deep insights to the organization on their weak points, how they can be connected to a full attack vector, how they can be monitored, detected, quarantined, and remediated.

I share my experience and insight through training and mentoring consultants, creating methodology documentation, and ensuring the quality of report deliverables.

## Published Software

- I've published tools/scripts in Python, Go, Ruby, Nim, and C#. I know enough C to read and modify source code, but not write it from scratch.
- Metasploit and Nuclei contributor
- Created private pentest team tools in C# for loading shellcode and .Net assemblies into memory and bypass detection. I don't plan on releasing them because I don't want them to get signatured by antivirus vendors.
- My project highlights:
    - [Goscan](https://github.com/sdcampbell/goscan): Golang. Single file TCP port scanner for use in scanning from compromised pivot hosts
    - [Nessusploitable](https://github.com/sdcampbell/Nessusploitable): Ruby script which parses .nessus files for exploitable vulnerabilities and outputs a report to stdout or file in TSV format for import to Excel
    - [Nmapurls](https://github.com/sdcampbell/nmapurls): Golang. Tool which parses Nmap xml reports from either piped input or command line arg and outputs a list of http(s) URL's to be used in an automation pipeline
    - [scope-resolver](https://github.com/sdcampbell/scope-resolver): Golang. Expands a pentest scope by taking an input list which includes IP addresses and parses DNS and TLS SAN hostnames and merges the results with the original scope list
    - [phpLFI](https://github.com/sdcampbell/phpLFI): Nim tool which tests for LFI in PHP apps and automates the process of abusing LFI's to download source code and discover new files via includes and recursively download additional source code files
