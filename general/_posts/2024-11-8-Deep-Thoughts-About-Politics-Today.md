This post isn't directed at you or anyone in particular. It's simply my thoughts on the state of politics and how people think in general. I'm not going to push my political views on you here, so please keep reading. This is about achieving harmony and healing through understanding.  
  
Every one of us, Democrats and Republicans, have our "world view", also called a "paradigm", or the lens through which we see and interpret the world. Our paradigm is like a filter, and it determines how we respond to information and process it. I think that most of us are inherently good people and we want mostly the same things, we just see the path to get there in different ways.  
  
We also have our ego and level of emotional intelligence to factor into how we see the world. When I was much younger, my ego got in the way of my emotional intelligence. But as I've aged, I've found that allowing my ego to get smashed followed by self introspection and reflection has led to multiplying my emotional intelligence many times over. I've learned that I now appreciate it when people give me constructive criticism and are brutally honest with me, provided that they're actually trying to help and not be cruel. Basically, there have been times that people have said things to me that in the moment felt like a punch in the gut and I was hurt. But through taking some time to think about it and reflect instead of immediately reacting, I had some emotional breakthroughs that lead to significant insight and growth of emotional intelligence.  I now view no-holds barred feedback as the best gift anyone can give me, because it allows me to escape my current paradigm, learn, and grow.

Here's something that I learned that helps you make the mental transition from being hurt by brutal feedback to loving it and achieving personal growth. One of the main differences between humans and animals is that animals are more reactive for survival purposes, but humans have the ability to be proactive. Being proactive is usually understood to mean anticipating and planning, but in the case of emotional intelligence it can be used in a different context. To be emotionally proactive, when you encounter something that triggers a negative feeling, stop and take some time to think about it before you respond. Ask yourself questions and think it over. Take days to think about it if it really triggered some bad emotions. While you're thinking about it, set your ego and emotions aside and think logically.

Here's learning point #1: When you see or hear something about politics in the media and it triggers an emotional response, automatically react with skepticism, especially when the source of information agrees with your paradigm! This is crucial for expanding your mind and reaching maximum emotional intelligence.
  
Now, let's think about how all of us tend to think about politics in general. I'm going to sort everyone into two different baskets, totally not related to political affiliation. The sort algorithm is based on emotional intelligence. 
  
The result of the sort algorithm isn't saying that you're wrong, or have affiliated with the wrong political party. This is about examining our paradigm and growing in emotional intelligence. This is about healing and personal growth, and smashing the barriers that limit us from achieving our full potential. Follow along please, because what I've learned here has led to great personal and professional growth, including skyrocketing my career, tripling my salary, and understanding myself and relationships much better. I will always be a work in progress, never assuming that I have the answers or that my view is correct.

In one basket, you have the "scientist". Think about how during the COVID-19 outbreak, people said "trust the science". There's a huge problem with saying that. To illustrate, here's a conversation I had with the most intelligent Artificial Intelligence agent available today:

Me:
>Let's talk about how scientists do research and relate that to people who say "trust the science". Don't scientists welcome it when people either refute or validate their published papers? If we're really being "scientific", isn't it wrong to simply "trust the science"?

AI's response:
>You raise an important point about the nature of scientific inquiry. The scientific method is inherently based on questioning, testing, and refining our understanding - not on blind trust or appeal to authority.
>
>Scientists generally welcome scrutiny of their work through: Peer review before publication, Replication studies by other researchers, Challenges to their methods or conclusions, New evidence that may support or contradict their findings.
>
>The phrase "trust the science" can be problematic because it suggests science is about accepting conclusions rather than understanding the evidence and methods behind them. Good science involves: Transparency of methods and data, Acknowledgment of limitations and uncertainties, Openness to revision based on new evidence, Recognition that scientific knowledge is provisional.

I believe that people of voting age that think about politics like a scientist are in the minority these days. Instead of thinking like a scientist, people tend to allow their paradigm and "confirmation bias" to affect their beliefs. I believe that the majority tend to think like a "lawyer". Where scientists welcome challenges to their conclusions, the lawyer argues using proof or sources of information that agree with their internal bias. When you hear someone say "trust the science", it's a sure sign that they're the "lawyer" type.

These things I've learned about the above ideas and emotional intelligence have lead me through tremendous personal growth. Keep in mind that I'm not inferring that "I've outgrown you" or "I'm better than you so you should listen to me". What I'm saying is that it's opened my eyes (and mind) to politics and people and leads to understanding and growth.

In my earlier years as a voter, I voted for the candidate that I liked best. I formed my opinion based on what I saw or read from the news. I trusted that the news was impartial and honest. What started my political shift was at some point I was having a political discussion in an online forum and my views were challenged. I started spouting off a bunch of "facts" that I learned from the news media. Today we can expand the definition of "news media" to mean pretty much any media source because politics has infected everything you see and read online. 

The people I was debating challenged my views. I responded like the "lawyer" we just talked about. But something someone said made me realize I was a "low information voter" because I had simply memorized and regurgitated what the media "talking heads" were saying. I realized I never bothered to fact check, I simply accepted what the news media told me.

A quick aside about "fact checking": You can't trust the fact-checkers. Do your own research. If you simply checked Snopes or searched and found a few results in the search engine that back up what you believe, you're still being a lawyer. You MUST find sources that oppose your views and dive down that rabbit hole in search of the truth. Try to open your mind and understand the other side's point of view, even if you don't agree with it. A wise person once said "seek first to understand, then to be understood".

Since having that political debate and learning I was a "low information voter", I vowed to find the truth before the next election and stop voting based on who was more likable. That led to changing political parties. But it didn't stop there. What I learned made me distrust all news and media sources, and distrust both political parties.

I want to leave you with one challenge in closing: If you want to learn, grow and heal, do the following going forward:

1. When debating politics, first seek to understand, then to be understood. If the other person is talking and you're not actively listening and you're simply thinking about what you're going to say in rebuttal, you're not listening and you'll never learn anything new because you're stuck in "lawyer" mode.
2. When something in the news or media triggers a feeling of anger, disgust, or fear, immediately stop and realize that you're being manipulated. Keep in mind that the media only profits when they publish something inflammatory that triggers an emotional response. Politicians thrive and profit when we're divided and angry. If everything in the media was "puppies and rainbows", the media and politicians lose power and money.
